In this section we went over three main things <br />
1.JSX limitiation <br />
  a. JSX is not allowed to have adjacent jsx elements. You cant return more than one "root" jsx element. Workarounds include <br />
    1. Wrap it in a div or element. <br />
    2. Use a wrapper or React.Fragment <br />
2. React Portals. <br />
  React portals allow us to render child components into DOM node outside of the parent compnent. These are usually used for modal, loaders, etc <br />
 3. React Refs.<br />
 React refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements. This helps us with inputs and accessing data. We dont usually want to manipulate the data using refs. <br />
